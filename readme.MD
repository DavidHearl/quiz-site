## Issues
- The round_results is not deploying properly
- The results page needs to be styled when a user does not submit a value
- Round results does not show how many points were scored in each question.
- The celebrity round does not show half points in the round results

## Notes

When the user submits the form the database will update.
Poll the data with javascript then use the information to update the elements on the page.

- Keep the answers to the end of the round
- Keep the scores till the end of the round
