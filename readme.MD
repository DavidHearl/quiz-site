## Issues
- Which film is the oldest
- everyone sees everyones round results, make it so only the person sees their scores
- Timer from last entry
- Disable re entry in who is the imposter
- Rounding errors on the numbers movie release dates
- People can still cheat
- If the timer times out the quiz will break as the user has not submitted an answer
- Assign a player as the quiz master and use that instead of 'david'
